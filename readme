Portfolio Homepage project based on The Odin Project's "Project Homepage" assignment.
(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-advanced-html-and-css-homepage)

The main focus of this project was to create a basic homepage for a portfolio, using
responsive css techniques to keep it looking good regardless of screen size or orientation.

It's a really simple experiment, yet valuable lessons can be learned from it, such as
avoiding fixed dimentions for heights and widths, attempting yo keep as much of HTML's
natural responsiveness as possible, and not overusing media queries, as they are really not
the key to responsive layouts at all.

Also special thanks to Kevin Powell, for all the helpful tips!
